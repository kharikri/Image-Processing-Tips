# ImageProcessingTips

I just finished term 1 of the Udacity self-driving course. Term 1 has five projects and all of them required some form of image processing (to read , process and display images) as a pre-processing step for either computer vision or deep learning tasks.  The key to get better results with computer vision and deep learning is to get the image processing done accurately. Often times this involves proper scaling between JPEG and PNG image formats or converting to grayscale and normalizing an image or simply using the image processing packages OpenCV and Matplotlib correctly for the task at hand. In the following I address all these topics and provide recommendations.
